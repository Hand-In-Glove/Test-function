// Little Bobby is at the soft play centre. He is in the ballpool with his mum sitting nearby.
// Suddenly he spots the local bully coming towards him with a toy hammer in his hand.
// You know how fast Bobby can wade through the balls (kidSpeed), and also how fast the Bully is (bullySpeed).
// If Bobby can get back to his mum faster than the bully, he will be able to escape (mumDistance, bullyDistance)
// If not, he will get whacked.
// Write a function which returns “kid safe” or “kid whacked” depending on if he can get to his mum in time.
// Luckily, if Bobby’s big sis is there, she will sort the bully out and Bobby is safe regardless.

function ballPool(mumDistance, bullyDistance, kidSpeed, bullySpeed, bigSis) {
  //write cool code here...
}

module.exports = { ballPool };
